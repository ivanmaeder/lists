# Reducing Risk

From Rapid Development (Steve McConnell)

## Product

- Move some of the desired functionality into version 2. Few people need all of what they asked for exactly when they asked for it
- Deliver the product in stages—for example, versions 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0—with the most important functionality coming first
- Cut features altogether. Features that are time-consuming to implement and often negotiable include the level of integration with other systems, level of compatibility with previous systems, and performance
- Polish some features less—implement them to some degree, but make them less fancy
- Relax the detailed requirements for each feature. Define your mission as getting as close as possible to the requirements through the use of pre-built commercial components

## Resources

- Add more developers, if it's early in the schedule
- Add higher-output developers (for example, subject-area experts)
- Add more testers
- Add more administrative support
- Increase the degree of developer support. Get quieter, more private offices, faster computers, on-site technicians for network and machine support, approval to use higher priced developer-support services, and so on
- Eliminate company red tape. Set your project up as a skunkworks project
- Increase the level of end-user involvement. Devote a full-time end-user to the project who is authorized to make binding decisions about the product's feature set
- Increase the level of executive involvement. If you've been trying to introduce JAD sessions to your organization but haven't been able to get the executive sponsorship you need, this is a good time to ask for it
