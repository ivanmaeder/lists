# Classic Mistakes (Software)

From Rapid Development (Steve McConnell).

## People

- Undermined motivation
- Weak personnel
- Uncontrolled problem employees
- Heroics vs “steady and consistent progress and meaningful progress reporting”
- Adding people to a late project
- Noisy, crowded offices
- Friction between developers and customers
- Unrealistic expectations
- Lack of effective project sponsorship
- Lack of stakeholder buy-in, including “executive sponsor, team leader, team members, marketing staff, end-users, customers, and anyone else who has a stake in it”
- Lack of user input
- Politics placed over substance
- Wishful thinking

## Process

- Overly optimistic schedules
- Insufficient risk management
- Contractor failure
- Insufficient planning
- Abandonment of planning under pressure
- Wasted time during the fuzzy front end
- Shortchanged upstream activities
- Inadequate design
- Shortchanged quality assurance
- Insufficient management controls
- Premature or overly frequent convergence
- Omitting necessary tasks from estimates
- Planning to catch up later
- Code-like-hell programming

## Product

- Requirements gold-plating
- Feature creep
- Developer gold-plating
- Push-me, pull-me negotiation
- Research-oriented development. "Software-development schedules are reasonably predictable; software research schedules are not even theoretically predictable." (47)

## Technology

- Silver-bullet syndrome
- Overestimated savings from new tools or method
- Switching tools in the middle of a project
- Lack of automated source-control
